          Hello, my name is Lilian. I will tell you about myself. I moved from
          Brazil to Europe in 2018. Since then I started a new path in learning
          computer programming. Although, my professional history has begun in
          the early 2000s. I have my first background in environmental
          technology; a four-year undergraduate course focused on waste
          treatment. Following that, a two-year post-graduation course on
          ecological management of municipalities. I professionally developed
          and assisted a series of environmental projects in a consulting
          company for various clients for eight years. In 2010 I turned my life,
          working remotely as an audio producer and editor in a studio for
          another period of eight years. Working from home required a high level
          of commitment with the new company and made it possible to acquire
          knowledge in managing client accounts. Now a fresh start was in front
          of me once more, and I have accepted the challenge. I started in the
          web development trail with HTML, CSS, Javascript, general front-end,
          and accessibility courses. I took the CS50 Harvard online Course
          (Computer Science and the art of programming), being exposed to and
          training C programming, SQL, and Python, alongside the front end
          triad. I have been a student at Alura's programming school since 2019.

          I also took two courses on Coursera: Introduction to Computer Science
          with Python Part 1 and Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose.
          During this process, I have developed some projects that are available
          on my GitHub account.

          What do I bring to the table?/ How can I be an asset? In this new
          world configuration, the experience of efficiently work from home is
          crucial as it allows flexibility requiring a commitment to deadlines
          and the quality of delivery. I have fully adapted to this arrangement,
          meticulously maintaining the open channel to communicate with the team
          and organizing calendar work. At the same time, I can compromise with
          flexible deadlines, and I am comfortable with either Windows or macOS
          system command line management; I am friendly, looking forward to work
          and communicate, locally or remotely, in an international and
          multi-cultural environment. As a professional goal, it is essential to
          match a company that enables the opportunity to grow as a person,
          improving the knowledge and skills through internal and external
          projects. I am eager to learn, with the desire and flexibility to keep
          and develop a growth mindset in a global, innovative, and trusty
          environment.
